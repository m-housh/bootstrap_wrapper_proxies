# Bootstrap Wrapper Proxies

This is a python library, that compliments bootstrap wrapper also found in my repo's, this is heavily inspired by Flask-Admin.  Both of these projects are very much a work in progress, so use at your own risk, as I may push updates that break some 
functionality/tests as I'm using both of these library's in a larger Flask project.  This has only been used with python 3.5 so not sure on functionality with other python versions.

For the moment best way to see how it works is through the tests. But the gist is to have a simple database model proxy to easily create table's and forms for database model's.
