# Bootstrap Wrapper Proxies

This is a python library, that compliments bootstrap wrapper also found in my repo's, this is heavily inspired by Flask-Admin.  Both of these projects are very much a work in progress, so use at your own risk, as I may push updates that break some 
functionality/tests as I'm using both of these library's in a larger Flask project.  

For the moment best way to see how it works is through the tests. But the gist is to have a simple database model proxy to easily create table's and forms for database model's.

#### To Use - (Not an official python package so the repo needs to be added to your project directory)
